Take inspiration from the professionals and learn the best lighting tricks of the trade Don’t let lighting design be an afterthought in your self build or renovation. While it can be relatively easier to complement an existing lighting scheme with freestanding lamps, your hardwired lighting system does the majority of the heavy lifting in how you use a space. Get it right, and when the daylight starts to fade you’ll have a home that’s comfortable to be in and functional to use, but get it wrong and the whole atmosphere of the space will be off When we talk about lighting design, we don’t just mean choosing the right fixtures and fittings, but ensuring there is enough lighting of various types, highlighting and interacting with your space in the right way.

        des2Title: 'What are the Types of Lighting Used in a Lighting Design?',
        des2:'There are three main lighting types used in lighting design — familiarise yourself with the various terms used for each. You might like to consider using a combination of all three types in most rooms for a good ‘layered’ approach. Ambient lighting: Also called general or background lighting, this is the lighting that gives overall illumination to a room. Sources include large pendants, recessed downlighters, and even wall lights in some cases. Task lighting: This provides extra, targeted illumination to those areas where everyday activities take place, such as reading, cooking and working. Floor, table and desk lamps are all good sources of task lighting, as is that incorporated into cooker hoods and vanity mirrors; however, ceiling downlighters may be considered task lighting too as they are functional, rather than ambient. Accent or mood lighting: This is used to highlight objects or architectural features you wish to draw attention to, such as artwork, cabinets or sculptures. Directional spots on tracks, low-level chandeliers and recessed and hidden LED strips are all good examples. Using dimmers and asking your electrician to install your lights on separate switches so that each ‘type’ can be independently operated will make creating different moods easier.'
